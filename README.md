## Hello

I'm migrating from the jetbrains IDEs to neovim to ease the suffering of my very old laptop. Originally I was forking off of kickstart.nvim, but I wanted to experience creating my config from scratch. All this is to say that I am in no way an authority on configuring/using neovim.

## References

If you somehow stumble on this configuration and are looking resources to help you - I used these:

- [kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/tree/master)
- [typecraft's neovim course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHTeCSVAFNY&list=PLsz00TDipIffreIaUNk64KxTIkQaGguqn)
- [primeagen's "guide"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE&t=565s)

These references were incredibly helpful, but nothing was more useful than just reading the docs for major plugins (i.e. lazy, nvim-lspconfig, nvim-cmp, treesitter, mason). It's important to note that these references can quickly go stale - it's worth browsing the currently popular plugins [here](https://dotfyle.com/neovim/plugins/trending)
